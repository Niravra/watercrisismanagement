#WaterCrisisManagement

Integrated Water Replenishment and Management System Created a sensor-based centralized framework 
built on the Ecosystem Modeling of Software Architecture 


Problem Statement :

Water shortage is one of the biggest problems plaguing various pockets of the world today. 
By the time the officials are notified of the scarcity of water in their jurisdiction, there is a high chance that 
it turns into a crisis.
This results in drastic and unplanned replenishment actions which would result in a higher cost for the government.

Approach:

We create a centralized framework which caters to the various water replenishment strategies and itâ€™s respective costs based on the following parameters:
  Soil Type of the regions
  Artificial Source of Water
  Interstate Transportation of Water

The system follows a governance hierarchy in dealing with work requests.
